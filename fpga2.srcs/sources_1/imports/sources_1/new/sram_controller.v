// Manages a 100MHz memory module (10ns), with currently 2, could do up to 4, ports @ 25MHz
// each port has a 10ns window of access out of 40ns, they can write to their port for the full 40ns,
// or they can try to perfectly time their writes to the 10ns window they own the ram,
// but the former would be more flexible.
// Currently used by pixel reading, and pixel writing.
// Pixel reading is synced to a 10ns window of reading,
// pixel writing could be either 10ns or 40ns.
